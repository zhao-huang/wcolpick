# Colpick RemiX
Photoshop-like jQuery Color Picker plugin with various skins and layouts, touch, and responsive. <br>

# IMPORTANT
<b> This is only a prototype of the plugin with the support of alpha channel! <br>
I've added the bar of alpha channel and the inputbox of alpha value, but they currently do nothing... apart from changing the value of alpha in the inputbox! </b>

### Changes from PV7 to Beta 1
1. Alpha channel support: 70% completed!
2. Changed range of alpha to 0-100 (is a percentage) to respect standards.
3. Added support to hex shortcuts!
4. Now, if livePreview is 'false', the color will be updated only on click and release, for all elements of the plugin.
5. Now, if you change the value of a field by using arrows, the field's arrows will change color.
