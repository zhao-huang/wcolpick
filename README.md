# Colpick RemiX
Photoshop-like jQuery Color Picker plugin with various skins and layouts, touch, and responsive. <br>

# IMPORTANT
<b> This is only a prototype of the plugin with the support of alpha channel! <br>
I've added the bar of alpha channel and the inputbox of alpha value, but they currently do nothing... apart from changing the value of alpha in the inputbox! <br>
And... I've completed only the standard layout! </b>

### Changes from PV2 to PV3
1. Updated Color Schemes with the new elements.
2. Updated the Standard Layout (70% completed).
3. Added 4 options to show or hide the outlines.
4. Added compatibility with older browser to the alpha bar.
5. Fixed a bug that allowed to set a hue value, and saturation and brightness values, beyond the limits!
