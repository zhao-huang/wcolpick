# Colpick RemiX
Photoshop-like jQuery Color Picker plugin with various skins and layouts, touch, and responsive. <br>

# IMPORTANT
<b> This is only a prototype of the plugin with the support of alpha channel! <br>
I've added the bar of alpha channel and the inputbox of alpha value, but they currently do nothing... apart from changing the value of alpha in the inputbox! </b>

### Changes from PV6 to PV7
1. Redesigned Small variant to improve legibility.
2. Changed font to "Arial" to improve compatibility (there are no notable visual changes between "Arial" and "Aktiv Grotesk").
3. Generally improved all layouts, and reduced size of css files.
4. Bugfix.
